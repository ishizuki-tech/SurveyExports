    "Q1": {
      "question": "How much yield do you lose because of fall armyworm? Please think back over the last 3 seasons. (Percent or bags per acre are fine.)",
      "answer": "For the past three seasons, I have lost about 10 to 15% of my harvest to fall armyworm.\n This translates to about two to three bags per acre, based on a typical yield.\n This insect damages corn, especially on the leaves and ears, reducing overall production.",

    "Q2": {
      "question": "If you could harvest 10 days earlier, how much yield would you be willing to give up? (Percent or bags per acre.)",
      "answer": "If I had harvested 10 days early, I would have lost about 5 to 10% of my harvest.\n This is equivalent to 1 to 2 bags per acre, depending on the average yield.\n Early planting helps avoid some of the problems of pests and drought, thus reducing losses.",

      "question": "What level of pest or disease damage would make you stop using your current maize variety and switch to a new variety? (Give a clear threshold, e.g., % plants/ears damaged or severity.)",
      "answer": "If more than 30% of my corn plants or ears were damaged by pests or diseases, I would consider switching to a new variety.\n This is a level that significantly reduces my yield and makes the current variety unprofitable.\n Also, if the damage is severe enough to affect the overall yield, switching to a new variety would be a wise solution.",

    "Q4": {
      "question": "What would you expect from a new maize variety to replace the one you currently grow? Please be as detailed as possible (e.g., DTM, FAW tolerance, drought stage tolerance, typical yield).",
      "answer": "I would expect the new maize variety to have drought tolerance, especially at the critical flowering and pod forming stages.\n I would also like it to have good resistance to fall armyworm and other diseases to reduce yield losses.\n The variety would have a suitable maturity period, early or mid-season, and produce a consistent yield of about 25 bags per acre, compared to the one I am currently growing.",

    "Q5": {
      "question": "In a bad year, what is the smallest harvest you would accept and still plant this maize again next season? (Percent of usual harvest or bags per acre.)",
      "answer": "In a bad year, I would accept losing about 50% of my normal yield and still plant this\n corn the following season.\n This equates to 10-12 bags per acre, depending on the normal yield.\n At this rate, I still find the variety profitable and worth continuing to grow.",

    "Q6": {
      "question": "When in the season is drought most devastating for your crop? What is the most difficult drought moment? (e.g., pre-tassel, tasseling/silking, grain fill, pre-harvest.)",
      "answer": "Droughts affect my maze most during flowering and grain filling, as these stages are crucial for grain production.\n This situation is most difficult for me as water loss during this period significantly reduces yield.\n Droughts before flowering or before harvest are also difficult, but the greatest losses occur when the maze is filling the grain.",
