      "question": "Is this yield loss an average across all three seasons?",
      "answer": "10 percents per acre."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "question": "Is this 5% yield loss an absolute maximum you would accept?",
      "answer": "5 percent per acre."

    "Q3": {
      "question": "Is 40% the threshold for plant damage or infected plants?",
      "answer": "If maize streak virus affects over 40% of plants by mid-August, I will switch to a drought-resistant hybrid for better yields next season."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "question": "Is drought tolerance decrease of 15 bags/acre a significant yield reduction threshold?",
      "answer": "If maize streak virus affects over 40% of plants by mid-August, I will switch to a drought-resistant hybrid for better yields next season."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "question": "Was last year an unusually poor harvest year?",
      "answer": "I would plant again if I get at least 40% of last year's average maize harvest, which translates to around 5 bags per acre, hoping for a better season next year."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "question": "Does drought during tasseling typically cause pollination failure?",
      "answer": "Drought during tasseling (July-August) is worst because pollination fails, resulting in yield losses of up to 50% or more."
